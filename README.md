# Pomodoro Timer

Hello everyone, this is my first project in bash and i will document how this projects work.
1. First.
- Why and what's a pomodoro timer?
  - Pomodoro timer is a technique to study, basic we have 3 timers:
**Study/Work Timer** Time to do your tasks, study, your work. 
**Break Timer** Time to take a quick break like 5,10 minutes, of course depends how long is your study time.
**Long Break Timer** Time to eat, take a shower, clean your house, whatever you want, normally this breaks have one hour or more.
  - Well, but why i do this timer... of course i use pomodoro timer to study, i like this technique and works very well to me, and the another question is why not do it? It's a challenge to do it in bash for me and helps me a lot do study.

2. How it's work?
- This project i will explain my thought process to write the code.
- How works every line in the code ~~(the most important maybe)~~.
- Having fun!  Enjoy on this journey :)
